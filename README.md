## 1. Introduction
As part of the course "Integrated Systems for Industry and Space Applications" in our
ECE Masters at TUM we were
introduced to the challenges and conditions that may come to exist when developing
integrated systems in space.

Besides the theoretical aspect of said course, we also had the opportunity to develop
a project on the [Microsemi SmartFusion2 Maker Kit](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/products/fpgas-and-plds/system-on-chip-fpgas/smartfusion-2-fpgas)
which should consist of both software and hardware components, as integrated
systems do!

Said project had to somewhat emulate a typical space engineering situation and do so
using as much of the resources available possible. For our project we chose to emulate
a typical scenario in Space Engineering, where communication between devices may be affected
such that from a digital point of view specific bits of a payload can be "flipped" or corrupted.

Look at the [wiki](https://github.com/duclos-cavalcanti/microsemi-error-detection/wiki) for a detailed documentation!
